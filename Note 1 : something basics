Chaper 1 Basics
 1.1 Machine language  
        CPU 8086's machine code for finish the equation s=768+1288-1280 is
        101100000000000000000011
        000001010000000000110000
        001011010000000000000101
        Ir's very haed to read and understand and hard to debug
 1.2 Assembly language
        Because of the machine code is very hard to understand and debug,the pioneer of the compuer engineer invent the assembly language
        The assembly language is the machine language's writing format which is easy to remember and write
        such as 
        machine code:1000100111011000
        assembly code:MOV AX,BX
        Translation:The contents of the register bx to ax.

 1.3 Compsition of the assembly language
        Core:(1)The assembly commands: Mnemonic for machine code，have the corresponding machine code.
        (2)Pseudoinstruction: DO NOT have the corresponding machine code.
        (3）Other symble: Such as +、-、*、/ etc., recognized by the compiler, there is no corresponding machine code.
 1.4 Memory unit
        CPU Cores ---------(commands and data)--->Memory unit<----------------(Manually write instructions and data)
 1.5 Commands and data
        Distinguish in applications,but don't distinguish in Ramdom Access Memory and Disks,when CPU is working,CPU will distinguish
     the different imformation and give them different meaning.
        Such as 
               1000100111011000 ----> 89D8H(DATA)
               1000100111011000 ----> mov ax,bx(command)
 1.6 Memory units
        Memory is divided into different memory unit,number from 0.                               ---------------
        Such as a memory which has 128 memory units                                              |               |
        A memory unit could memory 1 Byte what is 8 Binary Bit.
        For Mass storage,we usually use KB MB GB TB etc. measurement storage space size
        the conversion is 2 ^ 10.
